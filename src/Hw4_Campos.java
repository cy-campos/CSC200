        PRELIMINARY SPECIFICATION:

        Specify the model with 3 numbers:

        > 1 3 5     (They can be 1, 7, and 19)

        The bias is: xxx

        Give me a 0/1 representation based on the above model:

        > 010100011

        The above 0/1 represents:

        > yyyy

        Give me a decimal:

        > -81.234

        Hey, it cannot be represented! Try again.

        Give me a decimal:

        -1.23

        The above decimal is represented as:

        0111011111 (you figure it out)
